I am a postdoctoral research scientist at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratoty, working with Prof. Lucas Cheadle. I completed my Phd in 2019 from Aix-Marseille Universit√©, where I worked at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) under the supervision of Prof. Laurent Fasano and Dr. Xavier Caubit. My doctoral thesis explored the role of Tshz3 gene in the development and function of the kidney. 

Prior to my PhD, I completed my masters degree in Virology from Complutense University, Spain where I studied the genetic variability og RNA viruses with Prof. Estaban Domingo. I am also a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) and worked at Laboklin, Germany for three years before my graduate studies
